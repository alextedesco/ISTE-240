                Before being taken over by Gatlinburg founder Radford Gatlin, the land was mostly home to 
                the Cherokee nation of Native Americans. They lived in the area for centuries and were key contributors 
                to its preservation.

                Gatlinburg was one of the prime locations during the Civil War with resistant 
                settlers for much of the war before finally inevitably turning in favor of 
                the Conferderates.
