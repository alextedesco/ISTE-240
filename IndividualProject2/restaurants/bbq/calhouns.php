            <p>
                Calhoun's was founded in 1983 with its first store in Kingston Pike. Their distinct and tasty BBQ methods 
                have earned them the title of "Best Ribs in America", a slogan they still use today. Since opening
                their first store they have expanded to restaurants all over Tennessee bringing the award winning 
                BBQ to the table. The Gatlinburg restaurant can be found at 1004 Parkway #101 and can be contacted at 
                (865) 436-4100.
