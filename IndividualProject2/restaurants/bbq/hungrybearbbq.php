                Hungry Bear BBQ is one of the most visited spots in Gatlinburg. They are well known for their cheap prices and large portion 
                sizes which will always make a family vacation on a budget that much easier to have fun in other areas of Gatlinburg.

                The Hungry Bear BBQ isn't as world renowned compared to the other BBQ places as it holds itself with a 3.9 star rating 
                out of 5. This does not make the restaurant bad in anyway as it is still on of Gatlinburg's best BBQ places.
