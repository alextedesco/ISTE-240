            <p>
                The Log Cabin Pancake House was opened in 1978 by the Huskey family. It is the longest running
                family owned restauant in the Gatlinburg/Pidgeon Forge area. In 2017 it relocated to a new location
                due to fears of more <a href="../../history/fires/fires_2016.html">Gatlinburg fires</a> putting risk to the restauant. It now resides on 327 Airport Rd
                and can be contacted at (865) 436-7894.
