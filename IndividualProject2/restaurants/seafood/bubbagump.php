            <p>
                The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company was founded in 1995 after entrepreneur Anthony Zolezzi bought the rights to the name 
                “Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.” from Paramount Pictures. Zolezzi did so in an attempt to turn around the financially 
                struggling company Meridian Products. Jumping on the success of Forrest Gump worked amazingly for the company 
                as now it is one of the largest seafood chains in America. They currently operate 34 stores and the Gatlinburg 
                store can found at 900 Parkway and contacted at (865) 430-3034.
