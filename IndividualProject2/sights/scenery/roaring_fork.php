                Roaring Fork is a stream in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, located in the Southeastern United States. 
                Once the site of a small Appalachian community, today the stream's area is home to the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail 
                and the Roaring Fork Historic District.
