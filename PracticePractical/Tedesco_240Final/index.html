    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    <h2>By Edward Allen Poe</h2>
    <div class="columns">
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,

        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        
        "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door --
        
                                 Only this, and nothing more."
    </p>
    
    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,

        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        
        Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow
        
        From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
        
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --
        
                                 Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain

        Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
        
        "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door --
        
        Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; --
        
                                 This it is, and nothing more."</p>

    <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,

        "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
        
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
        
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        
        That I scarce was sure I heard you " -- here I opened wide the door; ----
        
                                 Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
    <div class="center">

    <h3>Alex Tedesco</h3>
    </div>

    <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,

        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
        
        But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
        
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
        
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --
        
                                 Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
    
    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,

        In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
        
        Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
        
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door --
        
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --
        
                                 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>

    <span style="color:blue;font-style: italic;">
    <p>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting

        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        
        And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
        
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        
                                 Shall be lifted -- nevermore!
